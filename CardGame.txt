GOAL:   The goal of this program is to create a basic card game framework
        where it keeps track of card locations for as many hands as needed

INPUT: No input is required from the user

OUTPUT: Displays the location of all cards including:
            assigned card number, card name, and
            location of the card.
        Displays the player's (user) hand (5 cards)
        Displays the computer's hand (5 cards)

1) add in the random module to obtain a random integer later
2) assign the number 52 to variable name 'NUMCARDS'
3) assign the number 0 to variable name 'DECK'
4) assign the number 1 to variable name 'PLAYER'
5) assign the number 2 to variable name 'COMP'
6) the variabale name 'cardLoc' gets assigned an array of 0 repeated the number of times NUMCARDS represents
7) assign an list to variable name 'suitName'
8) assign another list to variable name 'rankName'
9) assign another list to variable name 'playerName'
10) define function main():

    a) defining clearDeck() function:
        INPUT: N/A
        OUTPUT: N/A

        STEPS:  1) set up a for loop where i is the temporary variable
                2) i gets iterated the number value of NUMCARDS (52) times
                3) these iterated numbers get stored in variable DECK

    c)

    b) defining showDeck() function:
        INPUT: N/A
        OUTPUT: List of all cards
                Card number
                Card name
                Card location

        STEPS:  1) print the header and columns names to the user
                    (card number, name, location)
                2) assign 0 to variable named 'card'
                3) set up a for loop where the
                    a) variable name 'rank' is assigned the modulus remainder value of the card divided by 13
                    b) variable name 'suit' is assigned the integer value of the card number divided by 13
                    c) variable 'card' gets 1 added to it
                    d) prints out the correct card information as a list
                        1) card displays the number
                        2) rankName[rank] is the name of the card's rank based on the positional value of variabale 'rank'
                        3) suitName[suit] is the name of the card's suit based on the positional value of variabale 'suit'
                        4) playerName[location] is where the card is located once the cards are assigned

    c) defining assignCard() function:
        INPUT: N/A
        OUTPUT: N/A

        STEPS:  1) set up a while loop where deal is set to true
                2) when true, deal will perform the loop until condition is false
                3) assign variable 'card' a random integer between 0 and 51
                4) if the card position from the array cardLoc compares to the position of DECK then:
                    a) that card position in the array will be assigned to the variable 'player'
                    b) deal will then be equal to false which will stop the loop

    d) defining showHand() function:
        INPUT: N/A
        OUTPUT: displays 2 hands to the user consisting of 5 random cards:
                    hand 1 is the player's
                    hand 2 is the computer's

        STEPS:  1) print the header "displaying (player's or computer's) hand"
                2)set up a for loop where variable 'card' is iterated between 0 and 51
                    a) if the position of the card in the array cardLoc compares to the position int he variable player then:
                        1) variable name 'rank' is assigned the modulus remainder value of the card divided by 13
                        2) variable name 'suit' is assigned the integer value of the card number divided by 13
                        3) prints the name of the card assigned to the player or computer

11) run the main() function
